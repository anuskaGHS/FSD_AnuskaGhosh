        <h1>Loops in JavaScript</h1>
        <p>Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times until a specified condition is met. 
            They help to automate repetitive tasks and reduce code redundancy.</p>

        <h2>For Loop Example</h2>
            <script>
            for (let a=0; a<=5; a++){
                document.write("number: " + a + "<br>");
            }
            </script>

        <h2>While Loop Example</h2>
            <script>
            let b = 0;
            while (b <= 5){
                document.write("number: " + b + "<br>");
                b++;
            }
            </script>

        <h2>Do-While Loop Example</h2>
            <script>
                let c = 0;
                do {
                   document.write("number: " + c + "<br>"); 
                   c++;
                } while (c <= 5);
            </script>

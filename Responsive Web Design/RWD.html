        <h1>Introduction to Responsive Web Design</h1>
        <h2>Media Queries</h2>
        <p>Responsive Web Design (RWD) is an approach to web design that makes web pages render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. Media queries are a key component of RWD, allowing developers to apply different styles based on the characteristics of the device, such as its width, height, orientation, and resolution.</p>
        <h2>Example of Media Queries</h2>
        <p>In this example, the background color of the page changes to light gray when the screen width is 600 pixels or less. Additionally, the font sizes of the headings and paragraphs are adjusted for better readability on smaller screens.</p>
